# CineVibe – AI-Powered Conversational Movie Recommendation Platform

## Overview

CineVibe is an AI-powered movie recommendation platform that goes beyond traditional genre filters. It uses conversational AI to recommend movies based on a user’s emotions, moods, life situations, and preferences. The platform understands natural language inputs and provides context-aware suggestions, delivering a deeply personal and human-centric movie discovery experience.

## Key Objectives

- Enable users to discover movies through natural conversation
- Recommend films based on emotional context, not just genre
- Provide platform availability so users can watch instantly
- Attract Gen Z with aesthetic design and vibe-first UX
- Build a watchlist experience centered on feelings and personal moments

## Core Features

### 1. Conversational Movie Assistant
Users can describe what they're feeling or looking for in plain language:
- "I just had a breakup and want something comforting"
- "Suggest a slow-paced movie about finding yourself"
- "Looking for something to watch with my sibling, meaningful but funny"

The AI understands these inputs using GPT and suggests movies accordingly.

### 2. Emotion and Mood-Based Filtering
Search by:
- Emotions: happy, sad, heartwarming, intense
- Life situations: breakup, family night, long trip
- Tones: slow-paced, redemption arc, feel-good

### 3. Vibe and Theme Tagging
Movies are tagged by emotional tone and thematic content such as:
- Wholesome friendship
- Road trip with self-discovery
- Second chance at love
- Melancholy endings with hope

### 4. Personalized Movie Playlists
Custom playlists generated by the AI based on themes like:
- Movies to watch after a breakup
- Healing and self-love through cinema
- Bollywood films with strong female leads

### 5. Scene-Level Semantic Search
Users can search for specific types of scenes:
- "A movie where two best friends argue and then make up during a road trip"

The platform uses semantic search over movie summaries to match such requests.

### 6. Personality and Preference Learning
The system learns from user interactions and choices, building a vibe-based personality profile to refine future recommendations. Users can also take mood-based quizzes for personalization.

### 7. Mood Calendar and Daily Picks
A calendar-based UI suggesting movies based on day or mood:
- Monday: Light-hearted comedy
- Friday: High-energy action
- Rainy day: Introspective romance

### 8. Netflix-Style Hover Trailers
On hovering over a movie card:
- The card smoothly scales up
- A trailer auto-plays (muted)
- Additional information and a watchlist button appear

### 9. Direct OTT Links
Each recommended movie includes direct links to its streaming platform (Netflix, Prime Video, etc.), allowing users to start watching without needing to search.

### 10. Watchlist Functionality
Users can save movies to a personal watchlist:
- Add/remove with a single click
- View categorized by mood or theme
- Share as a public profile (optional)
